# AI-Driven SDN for IoT — Project Overview

An end-to-end software-defined network controller that uses a **Dueling LSTM-DQN** reinforcement-learning agent to route IoT traffic across a virtual 5-switch Mininet topology, all running on a single Manjaro laptop.

---

## What It Does

The system simulates an IoT network with sensors, cameras, and emergency devices on two access clusters (Cluster A and Cluster B). A Ryu SDN controller intercepts every new flow, asks the DQN agent which path to assign it, and installs OpenFlow rules across the switches. Every 2 seconds the agent observes a 20-feature state vector, computes a shaped reward, stores the experience in a replay buffer, and performs a Double-DQN gradient step. Weights and the replay buffer persist across runs so the agent improves over time.

---

## Quick Start

> All commands must be run in a **native terminal** (not inside the Flatpak VS Code sandbox) because Mininet requires `sudo`.

### First-time setup (once only)

```bash
# 1. System packages — in native terminal
sudo pacman -S --noconfirm openvswitch iperf3 python-pip

# 2. Start OvS
sudo systemctl enable --now ovsdb-server ovs-vswitchd

# 3. Python environment — from project root
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Patch Ryu for Python 3.10+ compatibility
python3 scripts/patch_ryu.py
```

See [[Environment_Setup]] for the full installation guide including known errors.

### Run a training session

```bash
# From project root, native terminal
sudo .venv/bin/python3 train.py --phase-secs 60
```

This starts all five components in the right order, runs 4 traffic phases (4 × 60 s = 4 min), prints a summary, and saves model weights + replay buffer automatically.

**Comparison mode examples:**

```bash
# Default: DQN controls routing + shadow baseline comparison
sudo .venv/bin/python3 train.py --phase-secs 60 --routing-mode dqn --baseline-policy least_utilized

# Baseline-only control run (for A/B demo)
sudo .venv/bin/python3 train.py --phase-secs 60 --routing-mode baseline --baseline-policy round_robin
```

**Flags:**

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--phase-secs N` | 60 | Seconds per traffic phase (total = 4 × N) |
| `--no-dashboard` | off | Skip the dashboard HTTP server |
| `--routing-mode {dqn,baseline}` | dqn | Select which policy controls live flow installs |
| `--baseline-policy {shortest_path,ecmp_hash,round_robin,least_utilized,random}` | least_utilized | Baseline policy for baseline mode + shadow comparison |
| `--no-shadow-compare` | off | Disable DQN-vs-baseline shadow metrics |

### Running on Mac (Actual Model Training)

Since Mininet requires a Linux kernel, use the provided Docker simulation environment to perform actual model training on macOS. This environment runs a full virtual network with Ryu, OvS, and the DQN agent.

```bash
# Start the full simulation (Ryu + Mininet + DQN Training)
docker compose -f docker-compose.sim.yml up --build
```

- **Dashboard:** http://localhost:8080
- **REST API:** http://localhost:5000

*Note: This requires Docker Desktop for Mac and runs in privileged mode to manage the virtual network.*

### Running on Mac (Demo / Mock Mode)

- Dashboard: http://localhost:8080
- REST API: http://localhost:5000
